	<h3>The basic functionality of the application</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				Navigate (zoom in/out, pan) around on the map until you find a place you want to create an event.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Click the pencil icon to start the drawing tool and draw around the area you want to include in the run, when you're satisfied with the area, click the check button at the bottom of the screen to accept this as the rough domain of the run.
				<br />
				Enter a Run Name, select your forecast and time span, and select a vegetation type. When you're ready to go, press the 'Create' button.
				<br />
				Additionally, if you wish to be notified when the run has finished executing on the server, ensure you have entered your email and or phone/provider in the settings menu and toggle the appropriate option(s).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The request is then sent to the server where it will execute and, if selected, notify you when the run is complete. You can also select the run from the dropdown list and click 'Run Status' to check the status and/or download the finished run data.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Once the run is complete and ready for downloading, press the 'Run Status' button and you should be presented with the option to download the data. Clicking "download" will show a download progress bar as it downloads the files locally.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Once all the data has been downloaded, you have a few options as far as what gets displayed on the map. You can choose to show the forecast layer from which the run was created, select your display type, and how many forecast hours you want to load with the 'Forecast Hours to Load' slider option (loading more than 5 hours of vector layers is not reccomended). Press 'Add Run to Map' button and the application will begin creating the layers and adding them to the map <strong>NOTE: this may take a long time, please be patient and wait for the spinner to stop and the map to refresh.</strong>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				You may also select additional fire-related map layers to display on the map in addition to the WindNinja outputs. These map layers are ONLINE only, so may be useful when creating your initial run(s). Currently the layers available are: GeoMac Current Fires &amp; Perimeters, and MODIS Thermal Satellite (two hosting servers available - wildfire.cr.usgs.gov and ActiveFireMaps.fs.fed.us)
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				To change the time of the run (if requested duration is greater than a single forecast), click the clock icon and use the slider to shuffle back and forth between the resultant layers (this will also change the forecast layer to match). The date/time of the forecast will be displayed at the top of the map.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				You can remove the run from the map with "Remove Run from Map" and get rid of the whole directory (if you're done with it) with "Delete Run" (deletes the directory and all the data within it - <strong>cannot be undone!</strong>).
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
